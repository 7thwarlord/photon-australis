## Why?
Because all you sexy Firefox users deserve something sexier than ugly, blocky square. (Who wants to be square, right?)

## 😍 How do I get this sexy thing? 😍
Since Firefox 57+, the only way to customize your browser UI is through `userChrome.css`. Learn more [here](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes). 

Rough instructions: 
1. Go to your Firefox browser, type `about:profiles` in your url bar.
2. Under the profile that is in use, open the Root Directory folder.
3. If that folder does not have a `chrome` folder, create a folder, name it `chrome`.
4. In the `chrome` folder, create a file named `userChrome.css`
5. Copy and paste the code that matches your Firefox theme. [Dark](./userChrome-dark.css), [Default](./userChrome-default.css), [Light](./userChrome-light.css)
6. Restart Firefox and enjoy some sexy curves :D
